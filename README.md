This worked is based on the article _Flocking for Multi-Agent Dynamic Systems:
Algorithms and Theory_ from _IEEE Transactions On Automatic Conctrol, VOL. 51, NO. 3_ in _March 2006_ wrote by _Reza Olfati-Saber_.


The code is not made to be efficient, the implementation is very naive. It's only purpose is to test the mathematical model proposed in the above article. To make it run smoothly, adapt the number of alpha-agents (N).
