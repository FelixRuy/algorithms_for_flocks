This work is based on the article _Flocking for Multi-Agent Dynamic Systems:
Algorithms and Theory_ from _IEEE Transactions On Automatic Conctrol, VOL. 51, NO. 3_ in _March 2006_ wrote by _Reza Olfati-Saber_.


The code is not made to be efficient, the implementation follows the mathematical model proposed in the article as the only goal is to analyse it.
To run the simulation, just run __simulation3.py__. If the display is not smooth, you can adapt the number of agents (N).
